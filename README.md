### CAll for Regulation support In Social MediA

This data analysis report is done as part of the selection process for a PhD student position on the project CARISMA at
the Institute of Information Systems and Networking (ISIN), SUPSI.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

The dataset contains tweets that mention virus and the virusShell vulnerability, involving arbitrary code execution.
The data has been gathered through the Twitter API and contains tweets from December 9, 2021 through December 24, 2021.

Its purpose was to study the evolution of the interest in the virus vulnerability.
In this project, we try to answer these Research Questions:

- RQ1: How is the correlation between retweets and favourites? Was this expected? Is this related to this dataset?
- RQ2: Can we observe different clusters of users based on their characteristics and/or sharing activities?
- RQ3: Can we use machine learning approaches to predict the number of likes/retweets/followers based on users'
  characteristics and shared content?
